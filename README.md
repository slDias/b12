# B12 application

Thank you for considering my application!

I'm a Backend leaning Full Stack engineer with 8 years of experience.

I'm very proficient in Python and Django as well as other frameworks such as Flask and FastAPI. And I've worked with JavaScript on both Frontend with Vue and React and Backend with Express.

Althought they are not finished projects, here are some other repositories that might be of interest:

- [FastAPI backend for a Todo/study tracking app.](https://github.com/slDias/study-platform-back)
- [React frontend for that same app.](https://github.com/slDias/study-platform-front)
- [React minesweeper game.](https://github.com/slDias/minesweeper)

These repos were all made with the intent of practicing those technologies and are not for real use.

Thanks again for considering me and hope to talk to you soon.
